Heyo!

I felt like my brain froze up during the interview and I wasn't able to showcase what I actually knew/was thinking. Classic brain.

Here's my more-finished thoughts. I tried to stay true to the initial approaches we started on. There's likely a lot to further tune but I also didn't want to spend too much time that the context shifted away from the actual interview.

I totally get that it wouldn't be fair to judge my interview + this submission against other folks who only had the ~45 minutes, but it's rare that I find a place that I leave each interview with a feeling like I'd really like working somehwere, and I've felt that way here.

To get started:

` npm run i`

To dev

` npm run dev`

To build and run

```
npm run build
npm run serve
```
